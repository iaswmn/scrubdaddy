Nothing stains the sponges. Ordered  three sets of the today\u2019s special value from QVC today. I can\u2019t wait to get the lemon lime  sponges and especially soap daddy.

I\u2019m Hannah and I work on the HQ Stories marketing team, part of Harper Collins UK. Lynsey Queen of Clean, has put me in touch with you about running a partnership competition for her book. \r\n\r\nWe are publishing Lynsey\u2019s new book on the 21st March, called How To Clean Your House. As I\u2019m sure you are aware, Lynsey has a highly engaged following of over 100k on her Instagram account, where she shares her best cleaning hacks and favourite household products with her audience. The book will encompass this, packed full of her tips and tricks for keeping on top of all the housework and enjoying yourself while you do. We think Scrub Daddy would be a perfect match in helping to promote this exciting title! \r\n\r\nWe are planning to run a competition, and are looking at placements for this currently. It would be great if you could donate some of your products as a prize. We would of course give you full credit. The competition would be well amplified across our channels, @HQStories has over 12k Twitter followers and the @HarperCollinsUK twitter account has over 110k followers. We will of course give you full credit donating the prize as part of our promotional activity around this. It would also be great if we could look to doing a small giveaway of the books on your channels as well, if that would be of interest to you. \r\n\r\nIt would be great to discuss this in more detail with you, and I will happily give you more details of the book and the competition mechanics if this is something that would be of interest to you. \r\n\r\nI look forward to hearing from you.\r\n\r\nMany thanks,\r\nHannah\r\n"}}, {"model": "contacts.message", "pk": 75, "fields": {"date": "2019-02-25T17:17:34.511Z", "phone": "8860074910", "name": "Rajat Gupta", "email": "rajat030592@gmail.com", "referer": "https://scrubdaddy.com/", "message": "I woluld like to be a sales channel partner for scrub daddy for india "}}, {"model": "contacts.message", "pk": 76, "fields": {"date": "2019-02-25T17:17:38.129Z", "phone": "8860074910", "name": "Rajat Gupta", "email": "rajat030592@gmail.com", "referer": "https://scrubdaddy.com/", "message": "I woluld like to be a sales channel partner for scrub daddy for india "}}, {"model": "contacts.message", "pk": 77, "fields": {"date": "2019-02-25T17:17:44.568Z", "phone": "8860074910", "name": "Rajat Gupta", "email": "rajat030592@gmail.com", "referer": "https://scrubdaddy.com/", "message": "I woluld like to be a sales channel partner for scrub daddy for india "}}, {"model": "contacts.message", "pk": 78, "fields": {"date": "2019-02-25T17:17:59.017Z", "phone": "8860074910", "name": "Rajat Gupta", "email": "rajat030592@gmail.com", "referer": "https://scrubdaddy.com/", "message": "I woluld like to be a sales channel partner for scrub daddy for india "}}, {"model": "contacts.message", "pk": 79, "fields": {"date": "2019-02-25T17:18:01.036Z", "phone": "8860074910", "name": "Rajat Gupta", "email": "rajat030592@gmail.com", "referer": "https://scrubdaddy.com/", "message": "I woluld like to be a sales channel partner for scrub daddy for india "}}, {"model": "contacts.message", "pk": 80, "fields": {"date": "2019-02-26T01:25:11.540Z", "phone": "84642262989", "name": "ShawnDuera", "email": "cmmet@msn.com", "referer": "https://scrubdaddy.com/contact/", "message": "Beautiful girls for sex in your city: http://valeriemace.co.uk/getsexinyourcity88111"}}, {"model": "contacts.message", "pk": 81, "fields": {"date": "2019-02-26T03:07:11.186Z", "phone": "8126130569", "name": "mildred thompson", "email": "t.millygirl@gmail.com", "referer": "https://scrubdaddy.com/contact/?eid=b5ENkBxWE5Uw4vKq%2BC00%2BHllA9Rjcm2fbSQhFlCPPTE%3D", "message": "hi,\r\n\r\nI think your company name is super cute and quirky, and I use your products to clean even the grimiest areas in my dorm building.

It can be a challenge to remove food and grease from the stove, especially when it has been neglected a bit.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n  Our how-to guide helps make cleaning less of a chore. Cheers to a clean kitchen in record time, thanks to Scrub Daddy!\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n  Depending on what type of stove-top you have these instructions may vary.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>How to clean up light stains on your stove top</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n  What You&rsquo;ll Need:\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n  <li>\r\n    Scrub Daddy sponge\r\n  </li>\r\n  <li>\r\n    Kitchen sink\r\n  </li>\r\n  <li>\r\n    Mild dish soap\r\n  </li>\r\n  <li>\r\n    Microfiber cloth\r\n  </li>\r\n  <li>\r\n    An old rag\r\n  </li>\r\n  <li>\r\n    Glass cleaner\r\n  </li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"page-images single-image\">\r\n  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  <img alt=\"\" data-crop=\"\" data-id=\"27\" data-source=\"/media/page_photos/0000/photo_27.jpg?_=1548746989\" height=\"576\" sizes=\"100vw\" src=\"/media/page_photos/0000/photo_27.normal.jpg\" srcset=\"/media/page_photos/0000/photo_27.wide.jpg?_=1548746989 1024w, /media/page_photos/0000/photo_27.normal.jpg?_=1548746989 800w, /media/page_photos/0000/photo_27.mobile.jpg?_=1548746989 480w\" width=\"1024\" />\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n  <strong>Directions:</strong>\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<ol>\r\n  <li>\r\n    Set aside any removable grates/knobs.\r\n  </li>\r\n  <li>\r\n    Saturate your Scrub Daddy completely with cold tap water (the foam should feel firm); quickly move to your stove top.<br />\r\n    <strong>Pro Tip: </strong>Fight your natural instinct here to wring out the water!

Anyone looking to upgrade their kitchen collection game should consider investing in just one piece. Here&rsquo;s why.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Copper Cookware 101</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n  There&rsquo;s good reason professional chefs have kept copper in their kitchens for hundreds and hundreds of years. It happens to be just as efficient as it is beautiful, conducting heat 5x better than iron and 20x better than stainless steel. High thermal conductivity goes beyond saving you prep-time. Once warm, a copper bottom pan distributes heat much more evenly than a traditional one. If your food has ever fell victim to a &lsquo;hotspot&rsquo; you can bet that won&rsquo;t happen. And because copper is so reactive, cooking takes place at a lower temperature that is also more easily controlled. A good general rule of thumb is to cut the suggested temp in half. Less heat equals less chance of burnt food. Copper cookware is substantial without being difficult to lift like&nbsp;cast iron, it&rsquo;s durable, corrosion-resistant and even antimicrobial. Yes there is upkeep involved but it&rsquo;s probably less invasive than you think, more on that below.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Buying Cookware</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n  There are a few things to consider when shopping. The depth of the metal plays a role in its overall quality; too thick or too thin is not good. This is less of a factor if you are buying from a reputable retailer but if you&rsquo;re not, 2.5mm is considered ideal.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"page-images single-image\">\r\n  <img alt=\"\" data-crop=\"\" data-id=\"38\" data-source=\"/media/page_photos/0000/photo_38.jpg?_=1548941185\" height=\"576\" sizes=\"100vw\" src=\"/media/page_photos/0000/photo_38.normal.jpg\" srcset=\"/media/page_photos/0000/photo_38.wide.jpg?_=1548941185 1024w, /media/page_photos/0000/photo_38.normal.jpg?_=1548941186 800w, /media/page_photos/0000/photo_38.mobile.jpg?_=1548941186 480w\" width=\"1024\" />\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n  Most copper cookware is lined with a non-reactive metal to help protect you and the copper. The most popular linings are stainless steel and tin, each of which has its own set of pros and cons. Tin is most traditional and does require extra care. Because tin is a soft material it can scratch more easily and will need to be retinned by a tinsmith at some point later in life. To avoid tarnishing, an acidic wash like the one at the end of this article should be used every so often. Stainless is less fussy in terms of maintenance and can withstand higher temperatures, however, it cannot be refinished if it gets damaged and is not non-stick. Similarly to cast iron, this can make it a little tricky to work with until it becomes seasoned.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n  There are also hybrid variations such as copper bottomed or cored pans- just don&rsquo;t expect quite the same level of conductivity from them. If you want the real deal, iron handles and all, we recommend our neighbors up north <a href=\"http://www.brooklyncoppercookware.com\" target=\"_blank\">Brooklyn Copper Cookware</a>. <a href=\"https://mauvielusa.com/collections/\" target=\"_blank\">Mauviel</a> is another great brand that has been around since 1830 and offers both tin and stainless lined collections. Don&rsquo;t let the cost of an entire set scare you, just one saucepan is all you need!\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Polishing Copper Cookware</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n  For maximum service life, hand wash copper cookware and avoid contact with harsh chemicals such as bleach. Below is a quick, chemical-free way to wash and polish your copper between uses.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>The Lemon method</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n  <strong>What you&rsquo;ll need:</strong>\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n  <li>\r\n    Scrub Mommy sponge\r\n  </li>\r\n  <li>\r\n    Juice from 1 lemon\r\n  </li>\r\n  <li>\r\n    Microfiber towel\r\n  </li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n  *The acid in the lemon juice is what breaks down the corrosion layer or patina. If you don&rsquo;t have any on hand, vinegar is an adequate substitute.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n  <strong>How often you should do it:</strong> Copper naturally develops a patina over time. To embrace this darkened color, apply the lemon solution only occasionally. If you prefer your copper to shine like a mirror, you&rsquo;ll want to do this regularly between uses.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n  <strong>Directions:</strong>\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<ol>\r\n  <li>\r\n    Hold your Scrub Mommy under warm water until soft. Squeeze out excess water.\r\n  </li>\r\n  <li>\r\n    Place the item you are going to clean in a sink or a shallow bowl.\r\n  </li>\r\n  <li>\r\n    Saturate Scrub Mommy&rsquo;s scrubby FlexTexture&reg; side in lemon juice. Using a circular motion, work in batches until you&rsquo;ve scrubbed all surfaces.\r\n  </li>\r\n  <li>\r\n    The results should be immediate! If you need more scrubbing power, add some cold water to your Scrub Mommy and repeat.\r\n  </li>\r\n  <li>\r\n    Rinse with warm water and dry with a clean microfiber towel.\r\n  </li>\r\n  <li>\r\n    Optional: to enhance the natural polish of the copper, rub a dab of vegetable oil over its surface.\r\n  </li>\r\n</ol>\r\n", "note": "Everything you need to know about this seriously smart

I found Scrub Daddy long before I knew it was a Shark Tank product - actually introduced to the classic yellow sponge by my grandmother (just as she introduced me to my boyfriend of 11 years!). When we were moving to Charleston, SC she said, \"this is all you'll need in your new house\" and handed me the sponge, and she was right. To date, I've bought and shared your product with people naturally because of how much I personally love the product! ...you would adore my Grams (who lives in Media, PA!) - always right. \r\n\r\nI recently watched an episode of Shark Tank that highlighted Scrub Daddy's success since being on the show and I was surprised to see that the company is based out of Philadelphia, notably Folcroft, PA. I was born in Ridley Park and grew up in Media - attending Penncrest High School, then Villanova and Penn State University. My whole family lives in the Philadelphia suburbs and Scrub Daddy would have been a company I called on when I worked at American Packaging. Your company would have been a dream account! I'd still recommend them as an amazing resource for packaging supplies if you need a knowledgeable contact and better pricing (stretch film, tape, strap, stretch wrap machinery, etc.). Regardless of the availability of jobs at this moment in the southeast, if you are not working with American Packaging, you should, and I would be happy to connect you! The owner is Mark Moses (484) 467-7130. Please extend my recommendation and have your team learn about how his company - another locally owned business - could reduce your costs and make a big difference! \r\n\r\nMy dream is to make a difference in a company I am working for and to be able to support myself while doing that. Since moving to South Carolina I haven't found an opportunity that stands up to American Packaging. I work hard for my worth and know that I can impact any company I am a part of, but my struggle in the south has been the value return. I am very comfortable working with a base pay and commission.

I want to first start by saying that I have been an avid Scrub Daddy user for many years now. I absolutely love your products so when I saw this Scrub Daisy Dishwand Set I just had to have it! I love the vase and all of the different attachments that go with this set. It does make washing dishes much easier. \r\nHowever, after using this for only a couple of weeks the \"Daisy Head\" is already tearing up. I am so very disappointed in this. I am not one to usually send an email complaining about things, but with the very high cost of this set and the high cost of the replacement heads I would have thought that they would last a little bit longer than a couple of weeks. I may be able to understand if I was using this to wash knives and other sharp objects but I do not. I only wash cups, bowls, plates, and other misc items. I have uploaded a few photos of the Daisy Head for you to see some of the areas that are tearing up. I did not take photos of each area that has torn up, only the few areas that seem to be the worst. With all of this being said, I do feel like I should state that the other two heads (The Sunflower and The Hyacinth) seem to be doing ok. \"The Hyacinth\" is starting to show a little bit of torn areas, but nothing like \"The Daisy Head\".  \r\nMy contact information is below. \r\nBridget Hancock\r\n518 Red Valley Road\r\nRemlap, Alabama 35133\r\nUSA \r\n(205) 908-8116\r\nBhancock1110@outlook.com", "reach_time": "8am-11am", "referer": "None"}}, {"model": "get_in_touch.getintouchmessage", "pk": 13, "fields": {"time_zone": "ET", "phone": "", "location": "", "reach_type": "Email", "name": "Corey", "date": "2019-02-06T04:03:38.327Z", "email": "collins.corey@sbcglobal.net", "comments": "Hello, my name is Corey.

At this event, typically attended by about 600 community members, we auction off gift cards, merchandise, and services generously donated by businesses like yours. The event proceeds are used to provide critical funds to help provide low cost pet spay and neutering assistance to the community to help combat the ongoing needless suffering and death of homeless pets. \r\n\r\nAlthough POPP\u2019s primary mission is to promote responsible pet ownership by offering low cost spay and neuter clinics, microchip clinics, and educational opportunities, POPP also provides funding for medical services, food, and support for our all-volunteer rescue foster care program. \r\n\r\nWe would greatly appreciate any donation you can make. Should you make a donation for the silent auction, your business will be recognized on auction displays at the event as well as in the auction program. Items that qualify for the live auction are listed in a special section of the program and are presented with a slide presentation that can include information about your company, your logo and a detailed description of the item which will be presented by our emcee and auctioneer. We will also provide a donation receipt letter for tax purposes and your records. \r\n\r\nIf you have any questions or need further information, please contact me at (509) 308-6858 or at FurBallDonations@gmail.com.

I was hoping that you might offer a more environmentally friendly version .\r\nI'll just keep using my cellulose based sponge until that time.   \r\n", "reach_time": "", "referer": "None"}}, {"model": "get_in_touch.getintouchmessage", "pk": 131, "fields": {"time_zone": "ET", "phone": "774-259-2217", "location": "", "reach_type": "Phone", "name": "Lisa Day", "date": "2019-02-16T16:58:19.654Z", "email": "lday@oalicanlaw.com", "comments": " I bought my first scrub daddy sponge approximately 2-3 weeks ago at Stop & Shop grocery store.

Since then we've been through our fair share of dish paraphernalia grabbing a new sponge here and there while making a quick grocery trip while at the moment realizing we needed a new sponge.  Scrub daddy never seemed to be an option while making an impulse buy at the local grocery store so we spent a year scrubbing dishes with generic sponge products.  After the holidays, I was in Bed Bath and Beyond returning a Christmas gift and I saw the huge display of Scrub Daddys (and Mommys!) and I had the Ah-Ha moment to stock up while I was there.  I was so excited to get home and get back to dish enjoyment, but I was shocked to see that the first sponge deteriorated almost completely just after 3 days.  I was shocked and even went back to look at the packaging to see if I bought the wrong one!  So, long story short, I sit here watching Shark Tank thinking of your product and am just let wondering what happened.  A product that was so great a year ago all of a sudden seems to be just like every other sponge on the market.  Just sharing my feedback, and hoping that perhaps I just got a crappy box.
